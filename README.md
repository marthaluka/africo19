Is SARS-CoV-2â€™s evolutionary capacity mostly driven by host antiviral molecules?

The COVID-19 pandemic has been characterised by sequential variant-specific waves shaped by viral, individual human and population factors.
SARS-CoV-2 variants are defined by their unique combinations of mutations and there has been a clear adaptation to more efficient human
infection since its emergence in 2019. Here we use machine learning models to identify shared signatures, i.e., common underlying mutational processes and link these to the subset of mutations that define the variants of concern (VOCs). First, we examined the global SARS-CoV-2
genomes and associated metadata to determine how viral properties and public health measures have influenced the magnitude of waves, as
measured by the number of infection cases, in different geographic locations using regression models. This analysis showed that, as expected,
both public health measures and virus properties were associated with the waves of regional SARS-CoV-2 reported infection numbers and this
impact varies geographically. We attribute this to intrinsic differences such as vaccine coverage, testing and sequencing capacity and the effec-
tiveness of government stringency.
